        # this version makes use of the Sweep_Interval object
        # the thinking behind this is that it would make it easier to write a two-channel sweep, e.g. BJT characterisation
        # you could write a method that could take two SweepInterval objects as inputs to manage
        # the sweep paramters, it would be cleaner than having 6 parameters which you would otherwise need
        # the two channel sweep would then be a nested loop; outer loop over v_fixed, inner loop assuming constant v_fixed
