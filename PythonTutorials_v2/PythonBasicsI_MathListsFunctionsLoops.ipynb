Beyond the tutorial, there is also the more formal specification of the full Python language for reference.

If that is the case we execute the indented part which appends a new element to our list. This gets iterated as long as the condition in the while command is fulfilled. Note the use of indentation here. The end of the while loop is indicated by the lack of indentation in the \"fiblist\" line. **Indentation is very important in python, and forces you to format your code in a well structured way.** Consider, for example, the difference between the two following blocks of code: "

    "a) Create a function called `third_deg_poly()` that takes in some variable `x` returns the value of a polynomial of the form $Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D$ where A, B, C, and D are provided by the user, with default values of 1, 5, 10, and 20 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Create another function (named whatever you want) that returns a **list** of `N` values such that it has the form $[x_0, x_1, x_2, ...]$ such that $x_N = $third_deg_poly$(x_{N-1})$ and with $x_0$, `N` provided by the user. Make it so that the user could change the coefficients of of the polynomial when they call your new function, but that they keep the same default values as in part (a)"
